7. What is the solution of this problem?

8. As you metioned in very first of this topic 'If we are working with a function that we called but we will use it later, that time we use the bind method', give an example of this.

9. What if we use the call or apply method instead of bind in your previous example?

11. Why we used the null in the previous example?
