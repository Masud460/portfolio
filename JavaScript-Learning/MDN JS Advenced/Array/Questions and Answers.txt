Q1: What is multidimensional array?

Ans: an array inside an array is called a multidimensional array.

Note:
    The pop() method returns the item that was removed. To save that item in a new variable, you could do this:

    const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"]; 
    const removedCity = cities.pop();
    console.log(removedCity); // "Liverpool"

Q2: What does the map() method?

Ans: Sometimes you will want to do the same thing to each item in an array, leaving you with an array containing the changed items. You can do this using map().
