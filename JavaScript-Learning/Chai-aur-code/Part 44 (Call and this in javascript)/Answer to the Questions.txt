1. That time the context of the inner function is 'Global Execution Context'.

2. The global execution context referes an empty object in node , and window object in browser.

3. Yes, that function is be called, but the variables of that outer side function will be vanish beacuse of the Execution Context.

4. There are many way to solve the problem, we just discuss one way in this tutorial, here it is:
    use the 'call' method with the function invoking.

5. This is very simple, just type 'this' in frist argument when invoking the outer side function in the main function.

6. Here is the whole practice:

    function setUsername(username) {
    this.username = username;
    
}

function createUser(username, email, password) {
    setUsername.call(this, username)
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
}

const userOne = new createUser('Masud', 'masud@google.com', 1234);

console.log(userOne);
