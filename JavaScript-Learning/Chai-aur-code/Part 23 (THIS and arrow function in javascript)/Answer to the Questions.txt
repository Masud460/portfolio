1. The problem is the JS don't know what the context is right now, so we need to tell JS about our current context by using 'this.' before the username variable like this:
    const user = {
    username: 'Masud',
    price: 499,
    welcome: function () {
        return `${this.username}, welcome to the website`
    }
}
console.log(user.welcome())

2. The first one will print 'Masud, welcome to the website' and the second one will print 'Jubaer, welcome to the website'
