üõ† What Can Be Improved?
1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization (6.5/10)

Instead of table.innerHTML +=, use insertRow() to avoid re-rendering the entire table.
Avoid redundant pop() calls in remove logic.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Code Reusability & Structure (7/10)

Right now, all logic is inside the event listener.
Create separate functions for adding/removing products to make the code cleaner.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Image & Product Data (7/10)

Instead of hardcoding products, load them dynamically from an array or API.
This will make the project more scalable and real-world applicable.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Better ID Handling (6.5/10)

Your ID generation (Math.random() * 50) could create duplicates.
Use Date.now() or a counter for unique IDs.
5Ô∏è‚É£ More Features for User Experience (UX) (7/10)

Add a Remove from Cart button.
Show a Total Items Count somewhere.
Allow users to add quantity instead of adding duplicates.
